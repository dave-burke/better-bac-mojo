<b>Graph Help</b>
<p>This scene displays a graph of your BAC over time. The default view shows you all the drinks in your history.</p>
<p>You can tap the box labeled "Graph Time Period" to select a "24 hour" view of your BAC over the last 24 hours only.</p>
<p>Note that the graph is not updated every minute like the main status screen is.</p>

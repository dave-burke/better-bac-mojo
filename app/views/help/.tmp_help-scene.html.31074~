<b>The main screen</b>
<p>The main screen will show you four things: Your current estimated BAC, the estimated time (in minutes) until
your bac would be at zero, and the estimated time (in minutes) until your BAC would be at the legal limit that
you set in the preferences screen (default = 0.08, which is the limit in all US states), and a list of the drinks
you have entered that are still estimated to be "in your system".</p>
<p>When open, the app will automatically update your status every minute. You may close the app, and it will
catch up the next time you open it.</p>
<p>As time passes, and your BAC decreases, the app will decrease the BAC of the first drink in your list until
it reaches zero. When the first drink in your list is zero, it is considered "out of your system" and will be
automatically removed from the list.</p>
<p>You can delete a drink by swiping it. When you delete a drink, it will remove the original BAC added by that
drink. In other words, it will be as if you had never entered that drink.</p>
<b>The drink list</b>
<p>Each drink in the list shows the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Drink name (top left)</li>
	<li>Drink vol. and abv (bottom left)</li>
	<li>The time the drink was entered (top right)</li>
	<li>The current BAC as a fraction of the total BAC contributed by that drink (bottom right)</li>
</ul>
<b>Adding a drink</b>
<p>When you have a drink, register it by clicking the "Add a drink" button at the bottom of the section
labeled "Drinks you've had".  You may then enter a drink name, the percentage alcohol by volume
(1/2 the "proof") and the volume (in ounces) of the drink you had. When you have finished, tap the "Add Drink"
button to save the drink and return to the home screen. Using the back gesture will allow you to return to the
home screen without adding the drink.</p>
<p>If you tap anywhere other than "Add Drink" on the add drink page, then the bottom section will update to show
you the predicted results of the drink you have entered. This is useful if you want to enter something as a
"test" to see how it would effect you (remember, you can cancel if you choose not to have the drink).</p>
<b>Have another</b>
<p>If you tap a drink in your drinks list, you will be taken to the add drink page with all the fields pre-filled
based on the drink you tapped.</p>
<b>Frequently asked questions</b>
<p>
	<i>When should I add a drink?</i><br>
	I usually add drinks when I finish them. At that point, the drink will be mostly absorbed into your system.
	If you drank the drink very quickly, then it would be more accurate to wait a bit. Then again, this app does
	not claim to be perfectly accurate in any case. Of course, if your BAC never reaches zero before you finish
	the drink, then it really doesn't matter when you add it; it'll just get piled on the end of the list in
	either case.

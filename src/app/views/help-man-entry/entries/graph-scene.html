	<p>To view your BAC graph, tap the "Graph" button on the main scene</p>
	<p>This scene displays a graph of your BAC over time. The default view shows you all the drinks you've had in the last 12 hours.</p>
	<p>You can tap the box labeled "Graph Time Period" to select a "24 hour" view of your BAC over the last 24 hours or "All" to see a graph of your entire history.</p>
	<p>Note that the graph is not updated automatically like the main status screen is.</p>

	<p>ABV is 1/2 the "proof", so if you drink something that is "60 proof" then the ABV is 30%.</p>

	<p>Some alcoholic beverages list this value on the packaging, but if they do not, you may have to estimate.
	You may also be able to find the ABV via a search of the internet. Many popular American pilsners are
	4.3% ABV. Craft beers range from 4% to 10% abv, but probably average somewhere around 5%. Wine is usually
	about 12%, but can vary by a few percent. Dessert wines usually have a higher ABV, around 18%.</p>

	<p>Calculating the ABV of a mixed drink can be difficult. One way to simplify is to ignore any
	non-alcoholic ingredients. For example, if you drink a Rum & Cola which consists of 2 oz. of 70 proof rum
	and 3 oz of cola, you could just enter "35" for the ABV and "2" for the volume.</p>
	
	<p>Alcohol By Volume is not the same as alcohol by weight.</p>

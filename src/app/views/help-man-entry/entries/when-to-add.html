<p>I usually add drinks when I finish them. At that point, the drink will have started being processed by your
system. If you drank the drink very quickly, then it would be more accurate to wait a bit. Then again,
this app does not claim to be perfectly accurate in any case. Of course, if your BAC never reaches zero
before you finish the drink, then it really doesn't matter when you add it; it'll just get piled on the end
of the list in either case.</p>

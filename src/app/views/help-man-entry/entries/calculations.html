<p>It depends on the calc method you choose in the preferences screen.<br>
Widmark: This is the older and more widely recognized method.<br>
Basically, this is the amount of pure alcohol in your drink
divided across the percentage of your body that will contain alcohol when you
are intoxicated.<br>
Each drink increases your bac by (vol*abv)/(weight*w) where "w" is the
"Widmark constant". The "Widmark constant" is the (estimated) fraction of the body mass in which
alcohol would be present if it were distributed at concentrations equal to that
in blood. Based on empirical studies, it averages 0.68 for men and 0.55 for women.<br>
Watson: This is a newer, more precise method.<br>
Each drink increases your bac by (vol*abv)(0.80 / TBW) where 0.80 is the percentage
water in blood and TBW is your "Total Body Water".<br>
For men, TBW = 2.447-(0.09516*age)+(0.1074*height)+(0.3362*weight)<br>
For women, TBW = -2.097+(0.1069*height)+(0.2466*weight)<br>
Basically, this is the same as the Widmark method, but with a more complicated
estimation of the equivalent of the "Widmark constant".<br>
No matter which calc method you choose, your BAC decreases by 0.015 per hour.<br>
The above explanations omit the unit conversions that need to be done.<br>
You might notice that age/height only matter for the Watson method, and even then
age only matters for men.<br>

<div class="snew-user-manual">
	<p>The main screen will show you four things:
		<ul>
			<li>Your current estimated BAC</li>
			<li>The estimated time (in minutes) until your bac would be at zero</li>
			<li>The estimated time (in minutes) until your BAC would be at the limit that you set in the preferences screen</li>
			<li>A list of the drinks you have entered</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>When open, the app will automatically update your status every 30 seconds. You may close the app, and it will
	catch up the next time you open it.</p>
	<p>As time passes, and your BAC decreases, the app will decrease the BAC of the oldest drink in your system until
	it reaches zero. When a drink in your list reaches zero, it is considered "out of your system".</p>
	<p>You can delete a drink by swiping it. When you delete a drink, it will be as if you had never entered that drink.</p>
	
	<p>Each drink in the list shows the following:
		<ul>
			<li>Drink name (first row)</li>
			<li>Drink vol. / abv / B.A.C. added by this drink (second row left)</li>
			<li>The time the drink was entered (second row right)</li>
			<li>Your B.A.C. before and after having this drink (third row)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

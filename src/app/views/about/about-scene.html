<b>Better BAC</b>
<p>This is a program for estimating your blood alcohol level. It should never be considered proof
that you are able to safely operate a motor vehicle. When in doubt, always use a designated driver.</p>
<p>This program was written by Dave. I made it because I wanted an app like this one.

<p>That means, among other things, that you are free to look at the source code, learn from it, and use it
in your own app. You may also change this app to create your own version of it. If you do change this app, and
you think your version is better, I'd be interested to hear about it.</p>
<p>This program will always be free of charge. I made this app for fun, not for profit. If you appreciate this
app, then give your cab driver or designated driver a few extra bucks.</p>
<b>Frequently asked questions</b>
<p><i>How is my BAC calculated?</i><br>
It depends on the calc method you choose in the preferences screen.<br>
Widmark: This is the older and more widely recognized method.<br>
Basically, this is the amount of pure alcohol in your drink
divided across the percentage of your body that will contain alcohol when you
are intoxicated.<br>
Each drink increases your bac by (vol*abv)/(weight*w) where "w" is the
"Widmark constant". The "Widmark constant" is the (estimated) fraction of the body mass in which
alcohol would be present if it were distributed at concentrations equal to that
in blood. Based on empirical studies, it averages 0.68 for men and 0.55 for women.<br>
Watson: This is a newer, more precise method.<br>
Each drink increases your bac by (vol*abv)(0.80 / TBW) where 0.80 is the percentage
water in blood and TBW is your "Total Body Water".<br>
For men, TBW = 2.447-(0.09516*age)+(0.1074*height)+(0.3362*weight)<br>
For women, TBW = -2.097+(0.1069*height)+(0.2466*weight)<br>
Basically, this is the same as the Widmark method, but with a more complicated
estimation of the equivalent of the "Widmark constant".<br>
No matter which calc method you choose, your BAC decreases by 0.015 per hour.<br>
The above explanations omit the unit conversions that need to be done.<br>
You might notice that age/height only matter for the Watson method, and even then
age only matters for men.<br>
If you want more information, look for an article called "Prediction of Blood
Alcohol Concentration in Human Subjects" by Watson et. al. As of 01/26/2010

<p><i>When should I add a drink?</i><br>
I usually add drinks when I finish them. At that point, the drink will have started being processed by your
system. If you drank the drink very quickly, then it would be more accurate to wait a bit. Then again,
this app does not claim to be perfectly accurate in any case. Of course, if your BAC never reaches zero
before you finish the drink, then it really doesn't matter when you add it; it'll just get piled on the end
of the list in either case.</p>

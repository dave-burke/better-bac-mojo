<p>This is a program for estimating your blood alcohol level. It should never be considered proof
that you are able to safely operate a motor vehicle. When in doubt, always use a designated driver.</p>
<p>This program was written by Dave. I made it because I wanted an app like this one.

<p>That means, among other things, that you are free to look at the source code, learn from it, and use it
in your own app. You may also change this app to create your own version of it. If you do change this app, and
you think your version is better, I'd be interested to hear about it.</p>
<p>This program will always be free of charge. I made this app for fun, not for profit. If you appreciate this
app, then give your cab driver or designated driver a few extra bucks.</p>
